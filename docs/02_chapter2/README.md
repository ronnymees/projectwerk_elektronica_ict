# Project workflow

To insure a good progress of the project the teams will follow this workflow.

<!-- Mag weg als alles overgezet is

**Important deadlines**

* week 9: Finished product, ready for debugging
* week 11: Finalized product
* week 12: Final presentation
-->




## Concept

We start project experience with a **kick-off moment** where students choose one of the presented projects and by doing so teams are formed.

1. Gather information
    * Get as much input from the product owner (a teacher) as possible.
    * Search the internet for relevant topics to gather more information.

2. Brainstorm

    ![image](./images/afbeelding4.png)
    * Mind maps allow the team to explore ideas and the connection between these ideas. The information gathered is used to do so.
    * The team generates a few concept ideas.

3. Working to one concept
    * weigh the pros and cons of each idea and by using parts of multiple ideas form one concept idea.
    * define subtasks to generate a proof of concept.
    * generate a list of needed items.
    * make a estimation of the cost for the project.

4. Get approval for a go ahead
    * present your concept to the product owner for approval.
    * make adjustments if needed.

**üìù Administration**

1. Redmine

    * create tasks and assign them to team members.
    * each team member registers his/her hours worked on a task ( once a day ).
    * when progress is made in a task then that also is set.

    ::: warning üì¢Attention
    Redmine is the only tool teachers will consult to view the progress of each team and the performed work of each team member.
    :::

2. GitHub

    Create new repository for the project and start writing the `README.md`.


::: tip ‚è∞ Deadline

By the end of week 2 each team should have the approval for go ahead from the product owner.

## Proof of Concept

Now that you have the go ahead from the product owner you start working towards a proof of concept.
Seperate parts of the concept need to be developed and tested. Information flow needs to be defined.

1. Breake down the concept in seperate parts.
    * define seperate parts that need to be developed an tested.
    * make sure the connection between these parts doesn't get lost.
    * use the scrum technique to get all the work done.

2. Make a orderlist for parts
    Always make sure you give the following information to the product owner:
    * Name and contact information of the supplier.
    * VAT number of the supplier.
    * the list of parts (part number , part description, price and amount)

    If the parts need to be ordered in a online shop then you can make a screenshot of the shoppingcart.
    If the parts need to be ordered by mail, then a quotation is needed.

    We expect the teams to provide in small (low cost) parts them selfs.
    The amount a team spends on the project should be equaly payed for by each team member and should not exceed 10‚Ç¨/student.

The main goal is proving the concept will work.

**üìù Administration**

Keep updating Redmine and add all files to the project repository.
All files that the team generates, if it's a piece of software, a datasheet, 3D print files, ... need to be added to the repository.

::: tip ‚è∞ Deadline

By the end of week 4 each team should have ordered the needed parts at the product owner.
By the end of week 5 each team should have a working prototype of the concept.

:::

### Half-way presentation

During week 6 each team will present there project to the teachers.
The presentation must contain:
* The problem statement 
* The concept
* The current status of the project
* The planning for the second half

## Prototype of product



## Testing

## Scrum technique

Agile Scrum is an iterative software development methodology specifically designed to build products faster. Agile Scrum uses short pre-defined development cycles (called sprints or cycles), with each cycle resulting in potentially shippable functionality delivered.

![image](./images/afbeelding2.png)

Each project will have a **product owner**, a teacher, that is the team's client. The product owner is the team's **first point of contact** during project experience.

The team appoints a **scrum master** that schedules weekly **scrum meetings**.
Tasks or **sprints** are defined with **timeschedules** which are **assigned to teammembers**.

## Redmine

To keep track of the project, its tasks and the workload of each team member we use the tool [Redmine](https://project.devbit.be/).

![image](./images/afbeelding3.png)

In Redmine all sprints must be entered with all there subtasks. Tasks must be assigned to team members. Each team member must register there work at the end of each day for each task they worked on. The progress of the tasks must be adjusted accordingly.

## GitHub

A project has a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vives-project-xp) where all files (source code, 3D print files, images, ...) will be pushed. This means that all tests, failing tries as well as the final versions will be pushed to GitHub. 

Each repository has a `README.md` that documents the project very well:
* What your project does
* How to install it
* Example usage
* Screenshots
* How to set up the dev environment
* License and author info
