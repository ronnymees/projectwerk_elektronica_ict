To keep track of the project, its tasks and the workload of each team member we use the tool [Redmine](https://project.devbit.be/).

In Redmine all sprints must be entered with all there subtasks. Tasks must be assigned to team members. Each team member must register there work at the end of each day for each task they worked on. The progress of the tasks must be adjusted accordingly.

::: warning ðŸ“¢Attention
Redmine is the only tool teachers will consult to view the progress of each team and the performed work of each team member.
