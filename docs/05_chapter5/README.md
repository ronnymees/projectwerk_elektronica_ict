# GitHub

A project has a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vives-project-xp) where all files (source code, 3D print files, images, ...) will be pushed. This means that all tests, failing tries as well as the final versions will be pushed to GitHub. 

Each repository has a `README.md` that documents the project very well:
* What your project does
* How to install it
* Example usage
* Screenshots
* How to set up the dev environment
* License and author info
